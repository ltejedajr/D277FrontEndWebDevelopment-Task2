            <h3>History of New York</h3>
            <div class="article-container">
              <h4>Early Beginnings and Colonial Era</h4>

              <p>New York's rich history traces back to its early beginnings as a Dutch settlement known as New
                Amsterdam, founded by the Dutch West India
                Company in 1624. Originally inhabited by Native American tribes such as the Lenape, the area quickly
                became a bustling trade hub due to its
                strategic location at the mouth of the Hudson River. In 1664, the English seized control of the colony,
                renaming it New York in honor of the
                Duke of York, later King James II of England. Under English rule, New York flourished as a diverse and
                cosmopolitan city, attracting settlers
                from various European countries and African slaves. The colonial era saw the establishment of key
                institutions and traditions that would shape
                the city's identity, including its characteristic grid street layout and its role as a center for
                commerce, culture, and politics in North America.

              <h4>Revolutionary Struggles and Statehood</h4>

                alt="Painting of colonial era soldiers during the Battle of Long Island" class="history-img">
              <p>New York played a pivotal role in the American Revolutionary War, marked by a series of struggles and
                triumphs that ultimately shaped the course
                of the nation's history. As one of the thirteen colonies, New York became a focal point of conflict
                between British forces and colonial rebels
                seeking independence. Iconic battles such as the Battle of Long Island in 1776 highlighted the city's
                strategic importance and the resilience of
                its inhabitants in the face of adversity. Despite early setbacks, New York emerged as a key stronghold
                for the revolutionary cause, hosting
                significant events such as the drafting of the Declaration of Independence and the inauguration of
                George Washington as the first President of
                the United States. The state of New York was officially admitted to the Union on July 26, 1788, becoming
                the eleventh state to join the fledgling
                nation. Its legacy as a bastion of liberty and progress continues to resonate, shaping both the state's
                identity and its enduring contributions to
                American history.

              <h4>Industrialization, Innovation, and Modernity</h4>

                alt="Photograph of ironworkers having lunch on skyscraper beam" class="history-img">
              <p>New York's role in the Industrial Revolution was transformative, propelling the city into a new era of
                innovation and modernity. As a leading center
                of commerce and industry, New York became a hub for technological advancements, drawing in waves of
                immigrants seeking economic opportunities.
                Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the city's skyline was reshaped by towering skyscrapers and
                industrial infrastructure, symbolizing its rapid
                growth and prosperity. Innovations such as the Erie Canal, completed in 1825, revolutionized
                transportation and trade, further cementing New York's
                status as a global economic powerhouse. The city's entrepreneurial spirit fostered breakthroughs in
                finance, communications, and manufacturing, with
                iconic figures like Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla leaving their mark on the landscape of innovation.
                Today, New York continues to be a beacon of
                progress and creativity, driving forward advancements in technology, culture, and commerce on the world
                stage.
